<b> Project Architecture </b>

- <b> Excel </b>
  - Using Excel, I will explore the data. Scanning through the Excel dataset file, checking the data, fields (column features), records, properties of the data, errors, inconsistencies and bad characters. This will give me a general idea of how we want to clean the data.

- <b> SQL </b>
  - I will then pass the dataset through to SQL for the data cleansing process. By setting up a database and table in SQL, I can then pass the dataset as a .csv file and import it into the table ready for data cleansing. Here I am defining cleaning steps and transforming the data to the required structure.
     - Within SQL, I will also test the data by performing a series of data quality checks to ensure 'high-quality' data (i.e. data that is complete and accurate)

- <b> Python </b>
  - In the next phase of this project, I will leverage Python and its powerful libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create compelling and informative data visualizations. These plots and charts will present key statistics in an easy-to-read manner, allowing for quick insights and clear understanding of important trends.
  - After generating individual visualizations, I will combine them into a comprehensive dashboard, which will bring together all these insights in a cohesive and interactive format. This dashboard will serve as a centralized platform for analyzing and exploring the data effectively.
