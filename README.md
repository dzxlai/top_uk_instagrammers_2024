<b> Project Architecture </b>

- <b> Excel </b>
  - Using Excel, I will explore the data. Scanning through the Excel dataset file, checking the data, fields (column features), records, properties of the data, errors, inconsistencies and bad characters. This will give me a general idea of how we want to clean the data.

- <b> SQL </b>
  - I will then pass the dataset through to SQL for the data cleansing process. By setting up a database and table in SQL, I can then pass the dataset as a .csv file and import it into the table ready for data cleansing. Here I am defining cleaning steps and transforming the data to the required structure.
     - Within SQL, I will also test the data by performing a series of data quality checks to ensure 'high-quality' data (i.e. data that is complete and accurate)

- <b> Power BI </b>
